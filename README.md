# Plant Disease Detection Using ResNet

the project aims to develop an automated system that can efficiently and objectively identify tomato leaf diseases. The system will utilize a tomato leaf disease image dataset [1] which consist of 11,000 images of tomato leaves, categorized into 10 different classes including bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf rot, tomato leaf spot, Septoria leaf spot, spider mite target spot, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, tomato mosaic virus, as well as a healthy class which can be framed as a multi-class classification problem. The distribution of each class category is balanced each class category has 1100 instance.
